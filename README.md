# SlumCast

The vision for this project is for it to become an all-in-one solution for Rocket League broadcasting. Combing real time in-game stats from the [SOS plugin](https://gitlab.com/bakkesplugins/sos) and deep post game / series statistical analysis from the [Ballchasing api](https://ballchasing.com/). This is being roughly built based on a proof of concept I made a while back. It's a React Redux base using [MDBootstrap 5](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b5/react) for styling.
